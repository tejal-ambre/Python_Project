An Employee Time and Attendance Management System is a software application designed to automate and streamline the process of tracking employees' working hours, breaks, leaves, and attendance. Developed in Python, this system leverages a combination of back-end logic and user interfaces to ensure efficient timekeeping and accurate attendance management.

Key Features:
1. Employee Registration: Allows administrators to register employees with unique IDs, names, and roles.<br>
2. Time Tracking: Records clock-in and clock-out times using timestamps, ensuring accurate work hour calculations.<br>
3. Attendance Management: Monitors daily attendance, marking employees as present, absent, or late.
4. Leave Management: Supports leave requests and tracks approved or pending leaves.
5.Shift Management: Assigns employees to different shifts and tracks compliance.

Benefits:
1. Efficiency: Automates manual processes, saving time and reducing errors.
2. Accuracy: Ensures reliable data for payroll and compliance purposes.
3. Scalability: Handles data for small teams or large organizations seamlessly.

Technologies:
Programming Language: Python for logic implementation.
Database: SQLite or MySQL for storing employee records and attendance logs.
Libraries: Flask/Django for web-based systems or Tkinter for desktop GUIs.
APIs: Optional integration with biometric or RFID devices for automated input.
This system enhances operational transparency and ensures compliance with organizational policies, making it a valuable asset for HR and administrative teams.
